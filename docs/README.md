# ukkonen
Create explicit suffix trees for papers or for fun using this program. Still *very* pre-alpha and a work in progress.

Below are some examples of the program in action.

These items remain on the todo list before this program is ready for prime time:
- rewrite generation code using naive algorithm to solve some odd bugs/edge cases
- close error pop-ups on enter
- change the printing method to print BFS style
- adjust the heights and widths of the levels based on the content
- rotate each character of text to be vertical
- prevent resizing
- clean up this weak readme
